How do I approach designing software?
    Have a clear understanding of your requirements. ...
    Start thinking about each component. ...
    Divide your architecture into slices. ...
    Prototype. ...
    Identify and quantify non-functional requirements. ...
    Visualize your design. ...
    Don't choose patterns.
  

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    Texturing
    Color inputs
    Lighting
    Inserting multiple objects in same scene
    

What design process did you follow for your project work?
    Planning and requirements gathering. The client describes a problem that needs to be addressed, which serves as the foundation for completing the rest of the           software requirements. ...
    Design. ...
    Develop. ...
    Testing and quality assurance. ...
    Deployment.
    

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    A tactic is a design decision that influences the achievement of a quality attribute response—tactics directly affect the system's response to some stimulus.           Tactics impart portability to one design, high performance to another, and integrability to a third

How do I approach developing programs?
    – Brainstorming. ...
    – Business analysis. ...
    – Design. ...
    – Programming. ...
    – Integration. ...
    – Quality assurance. ...
    – Release. ..
    

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    Everything I used in this project was new - 
    The use of lighting
    The use of textures
    The use of plotting points and meshes.
    

How did iteration factor into your development?
    I must have redone the same thing over and over and over again until it became muscle memory
    Repetition helped with knowing what coordinates to alter when it came to object placement, sizing and positioning.
    

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
    Yes it has, I never knew I could handle so much code being thrown at me but it seemed to turn out okay.
    I have a better understanding of C++ than I previously had.
    

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    My ultimate goal is to lead software development teams, more like a SDLC SCRUM enviroment but software related.
    Computer science helps with breaking the barier of technology based jobs.
    Plus it is a better prerequisite for IT related jobs.
